Sonda is a no-nonsense tool I built to pull together basically everything you’d want from a system info utility on Linux. Uptime, running processes, hardware stats, network configs, package versions — instead of juggling a bunch of separate tools, Sonda gives it all to you in one spot.

It also pushes real-time updates straight to your terminal — things like package installs, disk usage, memory pressure, CPU spikes, etc. Handy if you're keeping an eye on performance or troubleshooting something live without the fluff.



## Coverage

- [x] **System Info**

  - Pulls CPU, RAM, storage, and full hardware specs
